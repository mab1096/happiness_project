## Happiness Index Econometrics &amp; Data Science Project

Utilized R, Excel, & Tableau to independently conduct a full data science & econometric research project through: Gathering Data & Creating Datasets, Cleaning Datasets, Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis, Creating a variety of models and tests, then visualizing the data and writing a 20 page research paper. This project focused on how the World Happiness Index was related to a variety of variables, which I narrowed down to seven in the project. I utilized SLR, MLR, log transforms, A-B testing, and F-Tests in the project. E-mail me at mab1096unh@gmail.com for the full paper!
